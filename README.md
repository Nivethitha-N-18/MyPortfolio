 Welcome to my professional portfolio. I am a web developer with hands-on experience in building responsive and dynamic web applications using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. This repository highlights a collection of projects that demonstrate my proficiency in:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Python, C

Database Management: MySQL

Each project reflects my ability to design clean user interfaces, write efficient backend logic, and manage data-driven functionalities. This portfolio is part of my job search efforts and is intended to demonstrate both my technical skills and commitment to writing clean, maintainable code.

Please feel free to explore the repositories, read the documentation, and view live demos where available.
